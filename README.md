News API-powered News Website
Overview
This is a dynamic news website that fetches real-time news data from the News API and presents it on the user's screen. Users can search for news articles related to specific keywords, and the website will display the latest news related to their search query. The website has been developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, providing an interactive and seamless experience for users to stay updated with the latest happenings around the world.

Features
Real-time News: The website uses the News API to fetch the most up-to-date news articles from various reliable sources.

Keyword Search: Users can enter specific keywords in the search bar, and the website will display relevant news articles related to the entered query.

Clean and Responsive Design: The website's user interface has been designed with a clean and intuitive layout, ensuring a pleasant browsing experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

How it Works
Fetching Data from News API: When the website is loaded, JavaScript fetches data from the News API using HTTP requests. The API returns news articles in JSON format.

Displaying News on the DOM: The retrieved JSON data is dynamically rendered on the Document Object Model (DOM) using JavaScript. Each news article is presented with its title, description, source, and publication date.

Search Functionality: Users can input keywords in the search bar, and the JavaScript code handles the search functionality. When a user submits a search query, the application sends another request to the News API with the search term, and the API returns relevant news articles. The new search results are then displayed on the DOM, replacing the previous content.
